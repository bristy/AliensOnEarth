A treaty of friendship has been signed between Aliens and Humans. The aliens are now welcome on Earth and can stay as long as they wish with the Humans. You are the person responsible to register the aliens. 

<strong>Part A:</strong> Create a console based application that accepts alien details like Code Name, Blood Color, No.of Antennas, No. of Legs and Home Planet and then export these details into one of the 2 formats, depending on user’s choice - “plain text” or “PDF”.

<strong>Part B:</strong> Make the code extensible so that it is easy to ‘plug in’ a new format called ‘foobar’ without making changes to the application code.


This Project Takes Alien Data from User and export it into desired Format(TEXT/PDF etc).

How to Run:
Launching Class : Main.java
$ javac Main.java
$ java Main


For exporting data into pdf I am using iText Java Pdf library. (http://itextpdf.com/)
